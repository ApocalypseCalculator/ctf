# Hidden Txt

### Problem 

We are given a subdomain and asked to find the flag.

### Solution

When visiting the subdomain, we receive a DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error. 

Something is up with the DNS records then, if we take a look at the DNS records of the domain specified. 

We can see that there is a flag hidden in the TXT record of the subdomain.

Our flag is then `CTF{y0u_cou1d_fIt_4_whOle_w3b5iTe_H3re}`
