# Emoji Search

### Problem 

We are given a website with a list of emojis. 

### Solution

The emoji out of place is obviously `:post:`. That is not a real emoji. (just type it in Discord to check)

When clicking into the page, we find a greyed out `Flag` button. 

When inspecting the button, we first want to re-enable the button, then we want to fix the `form` the button is enclosed in, as it specified a `GET` request when it most likely should be `POST`.

Upon clicking the button, we are given 4 fragments of a base64 encoded string, 2 of which are hidden using a font size of 0. 

Decoding the base64 string gives us: `HBS{wm3z3_15_a0_u3i_p3eu1s9_1v_519uw}`, which is suspiciously close to the flag.

However, caesar cipher does not seem to work. Attempting vigenere gives us the flag. 

Our flag is then `CTF{th3r3_15_n0_r3d_h3rr1n9_1n_519ht}`
